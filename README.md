# asksite

>A template of the [Amy Storm Kosman creative website](https://www.askcreative.space)  
The fonts don't need to be in two places. I did that as an example of using the static and asset directory.

The template is for a [PWA](https://github.com/nuxt-community/pwa-module) 

Score for this repo..

This template has a [Nuxtent](https://github.com/nuxt-community/nuxtent-module) powered blog. [Nuxt-Netlify-CMS](https://github.com/medfreeman/nuxt-netlify-cms-module) is included.  
Styled with [Bulma](https://bulma.io/), [Nuxt-Bulma-Slim](https://github.com/mustardamus/nuxt-bulma-slim), and [Bulma Timeline](https://github.com/Wikiki/bulma-timeline).  
Lastly it also includes the [Sitemap Module](https://github.com/nuxt-community/sitemap-module).
